  <p>
    Have personally setup a CI/CD workflow, using Github Actions and Cloudflare
    Pages that serve a PWA with a Service Worker, so to allow rolling updates.

  <p>
    My day to day work involves Angular, Node.js + Express and middlewares,
    managing dependencies, and working with SQL Server.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a freelancer, I partake in providing services to a main client with
    Wordpress and CSS.

  <p>
    Naturally curious, I love to improve and perfect designs, while being aware
    and adjusting to schedules and deadlines. Able to self manage and work
    effectively and efficiently in a team setting.
